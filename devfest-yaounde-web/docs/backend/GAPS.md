# Backend ⇄ UI map: what can be wired for real, and what cannot

**As of 2026-08-31, `6be72fc`.** Companion to `docs/backend/OVERVIEW.md`.

This is the map that decides, screen by screen, whether Phase 14 wires a flow
to the real backend or marks it pending. The rule it enforces:

> **Where the backend supports a flow, wire it for real. Where it does not,
> build the UI, mark it visibly pending, and record it here — never fake a
> success as if it happened.**

A faked confirmation is worse than a missing one. Someone who believes they
hold a ticket and does not is a problem at the door, not on the screen.

| Organiser check-in / orders | **Complete**              | Out of Phase 14's scope — G5     |

**Most of this is buildable for real.** The gaps are narrow and specific.

## The gaps

### G1 — Card payments do not exist

`PAGES.md` §7 asks for card as a secondary option. The integration is Mobile
Money only, and whether PawaPay covers cards or a second gateway is needed
**has not been investigated** (`remaining-work.md` §2).

**CLOSED 2026-09-03: Mobile Money only, definitively.** Nothing to remove —
no card option is rendered at all, not even disabled. A greyed-out button that never works reads as a bug
on someone's phone rather than a decision.

Card support would need a separate processor aimed at diaspora buyers. That is
a future decision, explicitly not this phase.

### G2 — No refunds or cancellation

<!-- Deferred 2026-09-02 to a future phase. -->

**CLOSED 2026-09-03: there are no refunds.** That is the policy, and it is now
recorded as evidence on every order (ADR 0022). Cancelling moves no money;
`amount_mismatch` still needs a human.

**Phase 14 does:** no cancel/refund control in `/account`. Orders are
read-only. The `amount_mismatch` state gets copy that says the team is looking
into it and **does not offer a retry** — the guide is explicit that retrying is
wrong there.

### G3 — Email provider not chosen

Templates and dispatch are written and bilingual; Resend is wired as the one
adapter. **Without `RESEND_API_KEY` nothing sends** — the payment still
completes, the ticket still exists, and `payment_events` records
`receipt_skipped`.

**DECIDED 2026-09-02:** don't promise an email that cannot send. The on-screen
QR and badge code are the source of truth; email is mentioned **only** when
`RESEND_API_KEY` is actually configured. The badge code also lives in
`/account`, so the ticket is reachable either way. This is a config gap, not a
code gap.

### G4 — No discount-code validation endpoint, on purpose

<!-- Confirmed 2026-09-02: apply at submission, reflect the server's verdict. -->

There is deliberately no "check this code" endpoint: it would be a free oracle
for guessing codes.

**Phase 14 does:** the code field submits with the order; an invalid or spent
code comes back as `discount_invalid` / `discount_expired` /
`discount_exhausted` and clears the field while **keeping the basket**. No
live-validation affordance that implies checking-as-you-type.

### G5 — Organiser tools are unbuilt (backend ready)

<!-- Deferred 2026-09-02 to a future phase. -->

`POST /api/check-in` and `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` both work and are
access-controlled server-side. The scanner and back-office **screens** do not
exist.

**Phase 14 does:** nothing — they are outside the three parts. `isOrganiser`
comes back from `/api/account/profile` if a later phase wants them. Also note
`remaining-work.md`: **check-in requires a connection**; an unreliable venue
network needs planning before the day.

### G6 — QR rendering — RESOLVED

The badge code is issued and shown; **the QR image is not drawn**, because
every reasonable way to draw one needs a call this phase cannot make alone:
a library (an ADR and a go-ahead), a hand-rolled encoder (several hundred
lines of Reed-Solomon, wrong-but-plausible output discovered at the door), or
an external service (which would send the credential to a third party).

**Phase 14 does:** renders the badge code as large, selectable text on the
confirmation screen and in `/account`. That is required regardless — a cracked
screen still has to get someone in — so what is missing is the convenience of
scanning, not the ability to enter.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-02.** [ADR 0020](../decisions/0020-qr-rendering.md)
approved; `qrcode` renders the badge client-side, with the readable code kept
alongside it.

### G7 — No per-attendee phone — CLOSED, no change wanted

The brief asked for "phone AND/OR email, at least one" per attendee. The server
does not allow it: `attendeeSchema` **requires** `email` and has **no phone
field at all**. Only the order-level `contact.phone` exists, and it is used
solely to pre-fill the PawaPay page.

**Phase 14 does:** requires the email (as the server does), and collects an
optional phone per attendee for the buyer's own record — clearly labelled
optional, and **not sent**, because there is nowhere to put it.

**DECIDED 2026-09-02: leave it.** Receipts go by email, which is the normal
way to reach a ticket holder, so email stays mandatory and no per-attendee
phone column is added. The optional phone the UI collects for the buyer's own
record is still not sent, and that remains correct.

### G8 — "This one's mine" — RESOLVED

Self-assignment drives **prefill only**. Nothing records which ticket belongs
to the buyer, so `/account` cannot distinguish "my ticket" from "a ticket I
bought for someone".

**RESOLVED 2026-09-03** (migration 0008,
[ADR 0025](../decisions/0025-ticket-ownership.md)). `tickets.is_self` records
which ticket the buyer kept. `user_id` says who paid; this says which one is
theirs to use. At most one per order, zero is valid, and it is not a security
claim — it grants nothing and is not checked against the signed-in address,
because paying with one email and wanting another on the badge is a real case.

Verified live: an order with one self and one other produced exactly one
ticket flagged.

### G9 — The non-refundable acknowledgment — RESOLVED

The checkbox gates the pay button in the browser. There is no field for it in
`ticketCheckoutSchema`, so a request posted directly to the API succeeds
without it.

**Phase 14 did:** ship the gate, because it is the right UI, without
pretending the consent was recorded.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-02** — decided that it must be evidence.
[ADR 0022](../decisions/0022-terms-consent-record.md): both schemas now
require `acceptedTerms: true`, and `payment_intents` stores
`terms_accepted_at` (the server's clock) and `terms_text` (the exact wording,
re-read server-side from the messages for that locale — never from the request
body). Tickets and goods record their own separate wording.

### G10 — The Bevy URL — RESOLVED

The free tier now sends people off-site to RSVP, and `BEVY_URL` in
`src/lib/site-config.ts` is `"#"`. **The free-pass CTA currently links
nowhere.**

**RESOLVED 2026-09-02.** `BEVY_URL` now points at the chapter's event page,
and the free-pass CTA was verified to reach it in both locales.

### G11 — Products have no `category` field

The brief asked for a category filter. `Product` carries `id`, `name`,
`description`, `priceXAF`, `images`, `variants` and `status` — **no category**,
and nothing server-side groups products.

**Part B does:** filters on **`status`**, which is real and is what actually
changes what someone can do, plus a search across name and description.
Inventing categories client-side would mean filtering on data the server does
not have, and they would drift the moment the catalog is edited.

**ACCEPTED 2026-09-02.** Availability + search is the filter. Categories are a
backend item, left documented.

**Deferred again 2026-09-02:** they will be packages rather than plain
categories, and the shape is not settled. Nothing to build until it is.

### G12 — No per-variant inventory — RESOLVED

The brief asked for out-of-stock variants to be individually disabled. The
catalog has **one `status` per product** and no per-variant stock, so there is
nothing to disable a single size against.

**Part B does:** shows and enforces availability at the PRODUCT level. When a
product is unbuyable the whole control set is disabled and says why, which is
the truthful version of the same intent. It does not grey out individual sizes
on a guess.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-02** (migration 0007,
[ADR 0024](../decisions/0024-per-variant-stock.md)). `Product.stock` lists
combinations with a quantity, declared in JSON and counted in the database —
the same split as tier capacity. Checkout reserves per combination under an
advisory lock, and refuses with `variant_sold_out:<product>|<size>|<color>`.

Verified live: a combination stocked at 8 took 8 and refused the 9th.

**The UI half is now possible and not done.** `variant_taken()` gives the
remaining count per combination, so greying out a single size is no longer a
guess — it is a frontend change with real data behind it.

### G13 — Fulfilment cannot be chosen by the buyer — RESOLVED

Orders **do** carry a `fulfilment` column — free-form JSON with
`method: "pickup" | "shipping"`, a note and a reference. But it is written
**only by organisers**, through `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status`.
`shopCheckoutSchema` has no fulfilment field, so a buyer's choice has nowhere
to go.

**DECIDED 2026-09-02:** the interactive choice was **removed**. A
pickup-vs-delivery control that sends nothing is a fake control — it invites a
decision and then discards it, which is worse than not asking. In its place is
an honest line: the team coordinates pickup or delivery after checkout.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-02** (migration 0006, [ADR 0023](../decisions/0023-buyer-requested-fulfilment.md)).
`shopCheckoutSchema.fulfilment` accepts a method (`pickup` | `shipping` — the
same two words organisers already write) and an optional note, capped at 300
characters. It rides on the intent and is copied onto the order under
`requested` at fulfilment.

The control is back on the screen, and this time it is real. Still a
**preference, not a shipping engine**: no zones, no fees, no windows — those
remain open (`PAGES.md` §11) and the copy still says the team follows up.

One thing that had to change alongside it: `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status`
used to **replace** the whole `fulfilment` column, which would have erased the
buyer's request the first time an organiser added a courier reference. It now
merges.

### G14 — Shop return policy — RESOLVED (consent persistence folded into G9)

**DECIDED 2026-09-02:** goods get their **own** terms — no refund for a change
of mind, but replacement for damaged, faulty or wrong items, and size exchange
on apparel while stock lasts. Exchanges are handled manually, off-platform.
Copy, FAQ and the shop's acknowledgment wording all say this;
`docs/content/refund-policy.md` records it as settled.

No backend was needed, and none was written: this is a policy someone honours,
not a feature.

What remains is **not** a shop-specific gap — the acknowledgment is a
client-side gate with no server record for tickets and goods alike. That is
**G9**, and it stays a backend-phase item.

### G15 — The bag is device-local

There is no cart on the server: `POST /api/checkout/shop` takes the whole
basket in one request. The bag therefore lives in `localStorage`.

**ACCEPTED 2026-09-02.** `localStorage` stands; a server cart is a
low-priority backend item.

It persists across navigation and reload on that device, and syncs between
tabs. A bag started on a phone does not appear on a laptop, and clearing site
data empties it — so nothing in the UI calls it "saved to your account", and
nothing should start.

### G16 — Community handles in the DP caption — RESOLVED

`PAGES.md` §9 asked the share caption to carry "prefilled caption + event
hashtag + community handles". Two of the three shipped. The handles did not,
because every entry in `SOCIAL_LINKS` is still `"#"` and guessing an `@name`
tags a stranger on every post someone makes.

**Amended 2026-09-04 by ADR 0034 / Phase 18:** the caption now includes
`@gdgyaounde` as well as the CTA URL. The handle was asked for explicitly.

### G17 — The DP photo mask is not the morphed shape

`PAGES.md` §9 asks for the morphed-shape motif on the frames. The frames
themselves are now real artwork — eight designed combinations of confetti,
brackets, halftone fields, tape, stripes and dashed rings, drawn by the
compositor (PHASE15 §3). **What is still plain is the photo MASK**: `DpMask`
offers `rounded` and `circle` only, per ADR 0015 and the standing instruction
in `DESIGN.md` §4.2 not to approximate the signature shape until the real asset
exists.

**OPEN — asset, not code, and narrower than it was.** When the shape arrives,
`DpMask` and `maskPath` in `compose.ts` are the two places that change; the UI
needs no edit, because the picker renders whatever `DP_FRAMES` contains and the
swatch already draws each frame's mask shape.

### G22 — Nothing records what an organiser did

`payment_events` logs the payment lifecycle. It does not log **people**. The
two privileged writes that exist — moving a shop order along
(`PATCH /api/orders/:id/status`) and moderating a card
(`PATCH /api/dp/gallery/:id`) — change a row and leave no actor, no before,
and no history.

For a back-office several volunteers can reach, where the state being changed
is money-adjacent and the moderation decisions are about people's faces, "who
marked this delivered?" and "who deleted that card?" have no answer.

**RESOLVED 2026-09-03** (migration 0011, ADR 0031). `admin_audit` records
actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp. Order status, check-in, wall
moderation, content publish, settings and discount writes all insert a row
after they succeed. An audit failure is logged and swallowed so a door scan
is never blocked by the log.

### G21 — The wall has no report path for visitors

**REVISED 2026-09-04.** Visitor report buttons came off the cards. Takedown
is email to gdgyaounde@gmail.com; organisers hide a card from the admin
wall (click to toggle `visible`). The report endpoint may still exist; it
is not offered in the UI.

### G20 — The community wall — BACKEND BUILT

Asked for in this phase: people save their creations, and the chapter shows
what the community made. The frontend is written and switched OFF — with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DP_GALLERY` unset the screen renders no wall control at all,
because a button that quietly fails is worse than no button (the same rule
that removed the fake fulfilment picker in G13).

**BUILT 2026-09-03** (migration 0009, [ADR 0026](../decisions/0026-dp-community-wall-backend.md)):
`POST /api/dp/gallery`, `GET /api/dp/gallery`, `DELETE /api/dp/gallery/:id`,
plus the queue — `GET /api/dp/gallery/pending` and
`PATCH /api/dp/gallery/:id` — the `dp_cards` table and the private
`dp-cards` bucket.

Verified against the live project: a real JPEG is accepted and re-encoded,
text claiming to be an image is refused, oversized dimensions are refused, a
pending card is invisible, **anonymous reads return nothing approved or not**,
approval publishes it behind a signed URL, the right takedown token matches
and a different one does not, and a removed object stops being served.

**The wall page shipped (ADR 0030) and the flag is on (ADR 0033).** Reports
land in the dashboard (G21). The pending queue is still an API, and is empty
by design while auto-approval is on.

**Fully specified** in `docs/backend/dp-gallery-contract.md`: the table with
its consent record, the three endpoints, validation order, rate limiting
through the existing `bump_rate_limit`, and the no-account takedown token.
Supabase Storage is recommended over S3 — the project already has Supabase
with RLS and a rate limiter, and the only AWS dependency is SSM for one
parameter.

**This reverses part of ADR 0015**, which said a gallery "should be a new
decision record, not a quiet feature addition". That record is ADR 0021, and
it also un-annotates the "Uploads (DP Generator)" section of the security
checklist, which applies again.

**Timing decided 2026-09-02:** the wall goes on once people are actually
producing cards — not before. Building the endpoints ahead of that is fine;
turning the flag on is what waits.

**The blocking item is still not code.** The wall publishes photographs of
people's faces on a public page. Review before publication, a takedown path and a
retention rule all have to exist, and someone has to run the queue. If that is
not in place, the honest move is to leave the flag off.

**Retention settled 2026-09-03: 200 days**, purged by the existing cron —
image first, row second. Pending and rejected cards are swept too: a card
nobody reviewed in two hundred days is not a reason to keep a photograph.

**What is still not code:** someone has to work the queue, and there has to be
a way to honour a takedown from a person who lost their token.

### G19 — Role badges — CLOSED, not wanted

The DP generator offers attendance badges only — "I'll be there", "Count me
in", "My first one", "Back again". **"Speaker", "Organiser" and "Volunteer"
are deliberately absent.**

They are claims about a role, and the generator has no login, no session and
no backend by design (ADR 0015), so there is nothing to check them against. A
self-selectable Speaker badge means anyone can wear one, which devalues it for
the people who actually earned it — worse than not offering it at all.

**DECIDED 2026-09-02: attendance only.** No verification method was supplied,
and the phase's instruction was to default to this.

**CLOSED 2026-09-03: not wanted, now or later.** The attendance badges — "I'll
be there", "Count me in", "My first one", "Back again" — are the whole set, in
both languages. If a role badge is ever needed, the team will hand out a
dedicated link rather than add a selectable one here.

Kept for the record, the two routes that would have existed:

1. **A per-role unlock code** handed to real speakers and organisers. Weak
   security — one leak and it is worthless — but arguably enough for a vanity
   badge. It is a frontend change plus a place to keep the codes, and it MUST
   ship with a plain line saying it is a soft check, not verification.
2. **Real verification**, once the badge can be tied to an account: the ticket
   tier or a role column would say who is what. That is a backend item, and it
   depends on G7/G8 (identity and ticket ownership).

Either way, `DP_BADGES` in `src/lib/dp/frames.ts` and one input are where it
lands. Until then the picker explains on-screen why role badges are missing,
rather than leaving people to wonder.

### G18 — The DP frame art is drawn in code, not by a designer

The eight styles are compositor primitives arranged by hand — patterns,
stickers, edge treatments and photo effects, all honest, on-brand and flat per
DESIGN.md §2.6. Nobody with a design tool has looked at them.

**CLOSED 2026-09-03: accepted as they are.** No designer pass is wanted. If
real frame artwork is
ever supplied as images, it needs a new decoration kind (an image layer) in
`compose.ts` and an asset pipeline — the current vocabulary is vector drawing
only. That is a bigger change than adding another entry to `DP_FRAMES`, so it
should be a decision rather than a quiet extension.

---

## Content, not code

Every ticket tier and product is **invented placeholder data** — `HAIKYU`,
`SONNET`, `OPUS`, their prices and their perks. Shape comes from `PAGES.md`
§7; the values do not come from anyone.

**Phase 14 does:** builds against the real files and their real shape, and does
not dress the numbers up as confirmed. Replacing them is
`docs/guides/updating-tickets-and-shop.md`, and it must happen before a real
sale (`remaining-work.md` §1, item 8).

---

## Config that blocks a real sale

None of this is code, all of it fails quietly, and **none of it is Phase 14's
to do** — it is listed so the UI work is not mistaken for readiness. Full table
in `docs/setup/remaining-work.md` §1.

The two that bite hardest:

- **`BADGE_CODE_SECRET` must be set and never change.** Every badge code
  derives from it, so rotating it invalidates every ticket already sold.
- **The AWS relay must point at this app.** Otherwise payments succeed, money
  leaves accounts, and nobody gets a ticket — with no error anywhere.

Settlement now happens primarily by **polling** (ADR 0019), so the payment
return page carries real weight: it is what issues the ticket while the buyer
watches. A five-minute sweep catches anyone who closed the tab.

---

## The one thing the backend points at that does not exist

**`/{locale}/payments/return`.** PawaPay sends every buyer there after paying,
and there is no page behind it — today they land on a **404 holding a completed
payment**.

This is the highest-priority screen in Part A, ahead of the tier cards.
