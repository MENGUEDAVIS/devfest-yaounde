/**
 * `/{locale}/admin` — the whole dashboard, in one server render.
 *
 * ONE ROUTE, not a route per view. The shell swaps views on the client, so
 * moving between Tickets and Orders is instant rather than a round trip —
 * which is what an internal tool being used at a door, on a phone, on venue
 * wifi, actually needs.
 *
 * The cost is that everything loads up front, so the reads are capped
 * (`LIST_CAP`) and the UI says "showing N of M" rather than implying it has
 * everything. For a first DevFest that ceiling is the whole dataset several
 * times over; past that these become paginated queries and the shell keeps
 * working.
 *
 * ENGLISH ONLY, deliberately. It is an internal tool, and translating it
 * would be effort spent on the one surface no attendee sees. The content it
 * DISPLAYS is still bilingual data, shown in both languages where it has two.
