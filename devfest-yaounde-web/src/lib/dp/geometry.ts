/**
 * DP generator — the card's layout grid.

 * Everything the compositor draws is positioned from here, so "aligned" is a
 * property of the geometry rather than of whoever last edited a magic number.
 * The crop control imports the same functions, which is what stops the box
 * that moves the photo from drifting away from the box that draws it.
 *
 * NESTED RADII DECREASE INWARD, by exactly the padding between each pair —
 * the standard rule, `outer = inner + padding`. Concentric rounded shapes
 * that all share one radius look wrong, and this card has three levels:
 *
 *   card 0.135W  →  (pad 0.085W)  →  photo 0.050W
 *   photo 0.050W →  (pad 0.035W)  →  plate 0.015W
 *
 * The plate ends up nearly square-cornered, and that is the rule working
 * rather than a mistake: a small element deep inside a very round one is
 * supposed to look like that. Matching the card's radius at every level is
 * what looks wrong.
 *
 * Every length is a fraction of the card's WIDTH, including the vertical
 * ones. That is deliberate: it means a 3:4 card has the same margins and the
 * same type size as a 1:1 card, and simply gets a taller photo, rather than
 * everything stretching with the aspect ratio.
