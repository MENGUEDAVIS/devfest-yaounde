/**
 * The dot field — behind the preloader, and over the hero's photograph.
 *
 * THE DOTS NEVER CHANGE COLOUR. They are ink, always, and what animates is
 * their OPACITY: a soft highlight drifts around the field and the dots under
 * it come up. That is the whole effect — a spotlight wandering over a printed
 * halftone, not a colour cycle.
 *
 * Canvas rather than CSS: the pattern itself could be a repeating radial
 * gradient, but gradients are banned as design surfaces (DESIGN.md §2.6) and
 * a per-dot opacity falloff is not something a background-image can express
 * anyway. A few hundred `arc` calls a frame is nothing.
 *
 * The drift is a sum of sines rather than a random walk — it never repeats on
 * a human timescale, it never jumps, and it needs no state between frames.
 *
 * ## Two callers, three differences
 *
 * The hero reuses this rather than growing a second dot field, which needed
 * three things the preloader never did:
 *
 * - **It sizes to its PARENT, not the window.** The preloader's parent is the
 *   viewport, so nothing changes there; the hero's is a section that is taller
 *   than one screen once the banner is up. A `ResizeObserver` on the canvas
 *   replaces `window.innerWidth`.
 * - **`follow` points the highlight at the CURSOR** instead of drifting it on
 *   a timer. Eased, not snapped — a highlight that tracks the pointer exactly
 *   reads as a flashlight, and the point is a spotlight wandering over a
 *   printed halftone. With no pointer yet it keeps drifting, so it is never
 *   parked in a corner waiting to be found.
 * - **`ink` sets the dot colour**, because "always ink" stops being right the
 *   moment the field is over a photograph rather than the pastel ground.
 *
 * ## It stops when nobody can see it
 *
 * The preloader's copy answered this by unmounting after a second and a half.
 * The hero's does not unmount — it sits at the top of a long page, and
 * without this it would hold a `requestAnimationFrame` open for as long as
 * the tab did, redrawing a few hundred arcs a frame at the bottom of the
 * FAQs. An `IntersectionObserver` cancels the loop when the field scrolls out
 * of view and restarts it when it comes back.
