/**
 * The plumbing behind every content list, once.
 *
 * WHY A SHELL AND NOT A FORM GENERATOR. The brief asked for a dedicated,
 * well-designed form per entity, and a schema-driven generator produces the
 * opposite — a column of identical boxes, which is exactly what it asked us
 * not to build. But writing the list, the drawer, the dirty tracking, the
 * confirm-before-delete and the save round-trip five times would mean five
 * places for those to drift apart.
 *
 * So the SHELL is shared and the FIELDS are not: each entity passes its own
 * layout as `renderForm`, and gets the same reliable behaviour around it.
 *
 * HOW SAVING WORKS. There is no per-record endpoint, and none was added: the
 * store keeps one row per collection, holding the whole array
 * (ADR 0031). So editing one record reads the array, replaces one element and
 * PUTs the array back through `PUT /api/admin/content/:id`, which already
 * does organiser authz, rate limiting, Zod validation and the audit entry.
 *
 * That has one consequence worth stating plainly rather than discovering: two
 * organisers editing different records at the same time will have the second
 * save overwrite the first, because both wrote the whole array. `baseline`
 * guards it — see the check in `commit`.
 */

/**
 * All the shell needs to know about a record.
 *
 * Deliberately not an index signature: adding one would let every real entity
 * type through, but it would also erase the type-checking inside each form —
 * `patch({ nmae: … })` would compile.
