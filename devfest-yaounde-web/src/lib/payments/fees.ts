 * Deliberately NOT `server-only`. This is pure arithmetic on a number

 * (`pricing.ts`'s `finalise()`, which is what gets charged) and the browse-

 * a discount exists at all. One shared function, imported by both, is what

 * to guarantee rather than merely intend.
 *
 * BASE PRICES ARE THE STORED SOURCE OF TRUTH. `tier.priceXAF` /
 * `product.priceXAF` — what an admin types into the dashboard — is never
 * rewritten to include the fee. It is computed at render/checkout time,
