/**
 * The strip of logos across the bottom of the hero — and, right now, mostly
 * the strip of seats where logos are going to be.
 *
 * IT USED TO HIDE ITSELF when no sponsor had signed, which was the right fix
 * for the wrong problem: an empty marquee reads as broken. But a strip that
 * is absent tells a company reading the site nothing at all, and this is the
 * one surface where "there is room for you here" is worth saying out loud.
 *
 * So the seats are drawn either way. Three logos beside three open seats is a
 * more honest and more persuasive picture than three logos alone.
 *
 * WHY THE MARQUEE IS CONDITIONAL. It scrolls only once the seats are full.
 * While any seat is open there is nothing to scroll past — the row fits — and
 * animating a line of dashed placeholders would read as a loading skeleton,
 * which is the one thing it must not look like.
 *
 * INTERACTIVITY LIVES IN `SponsorRow` (PHASE22 §A2/§A3). This component stays
 * a server component — it only reads translations and shapes data — and
 * hands the computed seat list to a client child for the spotlight/dim hover
 * and the cursor popup, the same split `DpWall`/`WallTile` already use for
 * the identical reason.
