/**
 * Every indexable route, in both languages, each entry naming its own
 * translations.
 *
 * `alternates.languages` matters more than it looks: on a bilingual site it
 * is what tells a crawler that /fr/tickets and /en/tickets are the same page,
 * rather than two pages competing with each other.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: `/account` (personal, and empty to anyone not
 * signed in), `/shop/cart` (someone's bag) and `/payments/return`
 * (meaningless without the deposit id that brought you there). All three
 * carry `robots: noindex` from `pageMetadata`, and this list has to agree
 * with that — a sitemap entry for a noindex page is a crawler being invited
 * to somewhere it is then told to ignore.
