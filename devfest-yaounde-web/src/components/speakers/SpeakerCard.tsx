 * (see docs/decisions/0009-speaker-interaction.md).
 *
 * TWO PRESENTATIONS, AND THEIR DOM PLACEMENT DIFFERS — this matters:
 *
 * - Slider (`popover` off): the panel swipes UP over the card's own image,
 *   so it must live INSIDE the frame, which clips it. Rendering it as a
 *   sibling of the frame instead was a real bug (PHASE12 §5): the closed
 *   panel is only translated out of view, so with nothing clipping it, every
 *   card's panel painted just below it and the detail appeared to be open on
 *   all of them at once.
 * - Grid (`popover` on): the panel opens BESIDE the card and must ESCAPE the
 *   frame, so it is a sibling and nothing on the path may clip it.
 *
 * In both, the panel stays mounted and `inert` keeps its contents out of the
 * tab order and accessibility tree while closed.
