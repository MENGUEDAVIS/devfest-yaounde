/**
 * Runs the browser suites, and FAILS IF ONE IS MISSING.
 *
 * That last part is the point. These suites used to live in a scratch
 * directory, and when it was cleaned between sessions the runner kept
 * reporting "0 failures" for every one of them — because a missing file
 * produces an error on stderr, and the old check counted lines beginning
 * with "FAIL". Eighteen suites silently stopped running and nothing said so.
 *
 * A test harness that passes when the tests are absent is worse than no
 * harness: it produces confident, false green. So the list is explicit, a
 * missing file is a hard error, and a suite that exits non-zero fails the run.
 *
 * Usage:  npm run test:browser        (needs the app on :4399 and puppeteer-core)
