/**
 * Push a content change out to the public site.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL — and it is the bug that made the whole dashboard
 * look broken. Every public page is statically prerendered (`●` in the build
 * output). So a photo uploaded through the admin was written to the database
 * correctly, read back by the admin correctly, and then **never appeared on
 * the site**, because /fr/team is HTML that was generated at build time and
 * has no reason to be generated again.
 *
 * That defeats the entire premise of the content store (ADR 0031): edit the
 * site without a deploy. Without this, every edit needed a deploy.
 *
 * WHY ON-DEMAND AND NOT `export const revalidate = 60`. A time window means
 * an organiser saves, reloads, sees nothing, and cannot tell a slow cache
 * from a failed save — so they save again, and again. Invalidating the exact
 * paths a change touched makes the reload after a save always correct, and
 * costs nothing on every other request: the pages stay static and cheap.

/**
 * Settings reach the announcement banner, which is in the ROOT LAYOUT — so
 * it is on every page, and every page has to be rebuilt.
 *
 * ## Why `revalidatePath('/', 'layout')` and not a loop over `/fr` and `/en`
 *
 * This used to call `revalidatePath(\`/\${locale}\`, "layout")` for each
 * locale — a LITERAL, already-resolved path together with the `'layout'`
 * type. The Next.js reference for this version says plainly not to do that:
 * "If `path` is a literal path like `/product/1`, omit `type`" — `type` is
 * for a ROUTE PATTERN with a dynamic segment placeholder (`/product/[slug]`),
 * telling Next which FILE to match against. `/fr` is not that pattern; the
 * file is `[locale]/layout.tsx`. So the call was a documented misuse of the
 * API — silently not the "every page rebuilds" it claimed to be, which is
 * exactly why a hero image could upload successfully, write to the database
 * correctly, and still not appear: the stale prerendered HTML was never
 * actually invalidated.
 *
 * The docs give the exact fix as their own worked example, titled
 * "Revalidating all data": `revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`. One call on the
 * app root, which cascades down through every nested layout — including
 * `[locale]/layout.tsx` for both locales — and every page beneath them.
