/**
 * The digit-roll counter — built for the remaining-tickets banner (Phase 20)
 * and shared with the home page stats (Phase 21) rather than written twice.
 *
 * Not a dependency: a fixed-height column of digits per place, translated
 * with a CSS transition. A CSS transition never animates the value an
 * element is FIRST painted with, only a change from one rendered value to the
 * next — so it rolls on a real update and never on page load by accident.
 * A caller that WANTS an entrance roll (the stats) paints 0 first and sets
 * the real value when it scrolls into view.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` drops the transition: the value is simply there.
 *
 * Digit columns are `1ch` wide with tabular figures, so every digit takes the
 * width of "0" in whatever face the caller sets — exact in the mono counter,
 * and correct in the display face the stats use.
