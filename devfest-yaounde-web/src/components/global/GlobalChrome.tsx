 * DESIGN.md §7c: the announcement banner and the navbar are ONE connected
 * component — identical width, identical horizontal alignment, banner
 * attached directly to the top of the nav (the Claude.ai credit-notice
 * model). They must never read as two mismatched floating bars.
 *
 * The "more interesting than a plain pill" behaviour (§7c) is a real shape
 * morph: with the banner open the unit is a large rounded rectangle
 * (radius-lg); once the banner is dismissed or the page is scrolled, the
 * unit morphs into a full pill and tightens. Dismissal animates the banner
 * height to zero via the grid-template-rows 1fr->0fr technique, so the nav
 * smoothly reclaims the space instead of hard-jumping.
