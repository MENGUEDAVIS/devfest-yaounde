/**
 * The discount field's whole behaviour, shared by tickets and shop.
 *
 * One hook rather than two copies: the two screens had the same four pieces
 * of state and the same staging logic, and the moment that logic became real
 * (a network call, a pending state, a stale-basket problem) keeping them in
 * step by hand stopped being realistic.
 *
 * ## The stale-basket problem
 *
 * A discount is a function of the basket — 10% off 30 000 is not 10% off
 * 45 000. So a code applied and then followed by "actually, three tickets"
 * leaves a number on screen that is simply wrong, and wrong in the direction
 * that looks like a better deal than the buyer will get.
 *
 * So the basket is re-priced whenever it changes under an applied code. The
 * server is asked again; its answer replaces ours. If the code has stopped
 * working in the meantime — it ran out, it expired — the discount is dropped
 * and the reason surfaces, rather than a stale saving lingering on screen.
 *
 * Re-pricing is free of the brute-force fence: only a REJECTED code charges
 * it (see `consumeOnDiscountFailure`), so a buyer adjusting quantities does
 * not get locked out of their own checkout.
