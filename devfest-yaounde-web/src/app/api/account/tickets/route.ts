/**
 * GET /api/account/tickets — the "My Tickets" dashboard feed (PAGES.md §7).
 *
 * A01 is enforced twice on purpose: every query runs through the SESSION
 * client (so RLS filters to `auth.uid()`), and there is no id parameter to
 * tamper with in the first place. Changing a number in the URL gets you
 * nowhere because there is no number in the URL.
 *
 * ## Why this returns more than the `tickets` row
 *
 * A ticket row holds a tier SLUG and no price. On its own that renders as
 * "SONNET" and nothing else — which tells the person who paid neither what
 * they bought nor what it cost them. So two things are joined on:
 *
 *   - the CATALOG, for the tier's real name, its sub-title and what it
 *     includes. Resolved server-side rather than shipping the catalog to the
 *     browser, so the page and the receipt email describe a ticket the same
 *     way, from one source.
 *   - the PAYMENT INTENT, for what was actually charged — the unit price at
 *     the time, any discount, and the order total. Read through the session
 *     client as well, so `own intents readable` is what permits it; a buyer
 *     still cannot see anybody else's order.
 *
 * The intent is the record of what happened, not the catalog: a tier whose
 * price changes later must not rewrite what someone was charged in September.
